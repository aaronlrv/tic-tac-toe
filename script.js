/// 3 modueles
/// gameboard gameFlowCOntroller
/// displayCOntroller

///gameboard would contain the array, detection of player input 
///gameflow would contain the turn system detection of player input may go here as well 
/// displayCOntroller would update the displays of scores and the gameboard (updated array)SS
/// convert array into board by creating a grid and then updating their content with markets in gameboard 

/// only factory function
/// players
/// "get" and "set" helper functions could go under factories

/// the whole "Start screen" "player selection" etc. can be spread out through multiple modules
/// would not recommend throwing start screen whole button thing into a seperate module
