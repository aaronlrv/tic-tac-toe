# Tic-Tac-Toe

This project is a web-app version of the classic board game "Battleship"

## My personal Takeways
I learnt how to use 2D array's and utilized them for win conditions here. I also recently got introduced to factory functions and classes syntax and implementing them for the first time using thos project.
